# tsclicker 🎧🖱️

👴 Made entirely in C

🌈 This autoclicker has the potential to remain unfound in a screenshare beacause of its nature, being a teamspeak plugin. No special randomization or anything like that is built yet in the plugin, it's not meant for closet cheating, but it's just a fun way to autoclick,

💻 I used codeblocks for this; the project file is included with the repo. To compile it just download the repo and open the .cbp file with CodeBlocks 20.03 or later.
For further question, contact me. Don't bother me if you find some code left from the original teamspeak sdk, i basically do not care. Have a great day.
